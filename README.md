This repository contains my personal website built with React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend).  
The site will host several of my pet projects, personal information, and contact links.

## Structure

/frontend - React (Vite + TypeScript + MUI)
/backend - FastAPI (Python)
/docs - Documentation, notes, and design drafts
/.github - GitHub workflows and automation


## Goals

- Create a personal site integrating my pet projects  
- Practice full-stack development with React + Python  
- Learn backend development, including database and authentication  
- Deploy a working public version on the web

## Next Steps

- Initialize the frontend with Vite + React  
- Initialize the backend with FastAPI  
- Add CI/CD configuration  
- Connect a database and implement simple APIs
